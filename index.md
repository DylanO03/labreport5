  1) #### Lab 6 Help
     I am currently having an issue with my grade.sh code in the list-examples-grader repo for lab 6.
     It seems that no matter which student submission I use, the file always fails a single test,
     even though I have way more than just 1 test. The grader can find the ListExamples.java file in
     the given repo just fine, and everything compiles without issue, but then it just says that there
     was a single test that failed. I attached what I see from the terminal and the code block where the
     error must be coming from, but I am at a loss, why does it only say one test, and why is it failing?
